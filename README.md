# Heart Health Alert System  
### End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline Using AWS EMR, SageMaker, Lambda, SNS, Athena, and S3

---

## 🧭 Project Overview

This project implements a complete cloud-based **heart attack risk prediction and alerting system** using Amazon Web Services.  
It simulates patient vitals, processes health data at scale, trains an XGBoost model, generates real-time predictions with AWS Lambda, triggers alerts through SNS, and delivers data insights with Athena.

The system reflects how modern hospitals and remote patient-monitoring systems use cloud-based machine learning for proactive cardiac risk assessment.

## 📊 Final Deliverables

### **1. End-to-End AWS ML Pipeline**
A fully operational pipeline integrating:  
- Amazon S3 (data lake)  
- AWS EMR (Spark preprocessing)  
- Amazon SageMaker (model training & deployment)  
- AWS Lambda (automated inference)  
- Amazon SNS (high-risk alerts)  
- Amazon Athena (analytics)

### **2. SNS High-Risk Alert Email**

## 🧩 Project Phases

---

## **Phase I – Data Generation & Ingestion**
- Generated 7-day simulated vitals for 20 patients  
- Uploaded both historical and simulated datasets into S3  
- Output: `simulated_vitals.csv`

**Files Included:**
```
phase1/generate_simulated.py
phase1/upload_to_s3.sh
```

---

## **Phase II – Data Processing Using EMR (Spark)**
- Aggregated daily vitals into weekly averages  
- Cleaned historical dataset  
- Joined datasets on Patient ID  
- Saved final dataset to `processed/` on S3  

**Files Included:**
```
phase2/spark/main.py
```

---

## **Phase III – Machine Learning Model (SageMaker)**
- Preprocessed dataset (split BP, encode categoricals, remove IDs)  
- Trained XGBoost binary classifier  
- Deployed real-time SageMaker endpoint  
- Generated `feature_list.txt`  

**Files Included:**
```
phase3/preprocess.py
phase3/sagemaker_train.py
```

---

## **Phase IV – Automated Prediction & SNS Alerts (Lambda)**
- Lambda loads the most recent processed CSV from S3  
- Preprocesses rows using `feature_list.txt`  
- Sends rows for real-time prediction using SageMaker endpoint  
- Saves results to `/predictions` in S3  
- Triggers SNS alerts for patients with risk > 0.45  

**Files Included:**
```
phase4/lambda_function.py
```

---

## **Phase V – Analytics via Amazon Athena**
- Created two Athena external tables:
  - `heart_attack_processed_data`
  - `heart_attack_predictions`
- Executed SQL analyses for:
  - High-risk patient ranking  
  - Risk by age groups  
  - Sleep duration correlation  
  - Activity vs heart rate  

**Files Included:**
```
phase5/athena_ddls.sql
```
